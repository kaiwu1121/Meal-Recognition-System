Computer Vision project.

There are two scripts that we need to run when dealing with this project.

First, run the script "bow.m". We will get the confusion matrix for training data.

Second, run the script "test_bow.m". We will get the confusion matrix for testing data.

In order to get the required output for the object, we need to extract recognition information from the confusion matrix.
